A complete binary classification project using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer dataset. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation with confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, threshold tuning, and visualization ideal for understanding sigmoid-based classifiers.

ðŸ“˜ Project Description
logistic-regression-binary-classifier
A complete binary classification project using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer dataset. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation with confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, threshold tuning, and visualization â€” ideal for understanding sigmoid-based classifiers.

This project also demonstrates:

How to scale features using StandardScaler for better model convergence.

The impact of adjusting decision thresholds (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.7) on model performance.

How the sigmoid function transforms raw model output into interpretable probability scores.

Clear visual interpretation through a combined plot showing:

Confusion Matrix (threshold = 0.5)

ROC Curve (with AUC)

Confusion Matrix (threshold = 0.7)

It serves as a practical reference for students, beginners, or anyone learning logistic regression and model evaluation metrics.
